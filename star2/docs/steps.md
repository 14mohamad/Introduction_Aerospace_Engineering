Based on the PROJECT.MD file, here's the roadmap to complete your star identification project:

  Project Overview

  You're building a star identification application that improves upon the existing star tracker algorithm. The project has both algorithmic and application development components.

  What You Already Have (from the template):

  1. Star identification algorithm - Already implemented in your notebook/Python file
  2. CSV files for reference coordinates - Generated by star detection
  3. Matching between images - Working matching algorithm using geometric features
  4. Test images - 4 images (fr1.jpg, fr2.jpg, ST_db1.png, ST_db2.png)

  What Needs to Be Done:

  1. Algorithm Improvement & Development

  - Optimization for accuracy: Refine matching thresholds, improve voting system, handle edge cases
  - Optimization for efficiency: Speed up computations, possibly use spatial indexing
  - Robustness improvements: Handle noisy images, varied lighting, partial occlusions, different image scales/rotations better

  2. Star Identification Application Development

  Build a complete application with these features:
  - Image upload functionality - Allow users to upload their own star field images
  - Algorithm execution - Run the identification algorithm on uploaded images
  - Star catalog integration - Connect to real star databases (Stellarium, Hipparcos)
  - Display similar stars - Show matching results from the catalog
  - Simple UI - User-friendly interface using Streamlit or Flask

  3. Application Environment Setup

  - Choose between Streamlit (easier, faster) or Flask (more control)
  - Integrate with star catalogs/databases
  - Create visual displays for results (overlays, side-by-side comparisons)

  4. Final Deliverables

  1. Improved algorithm - Enhanced version of current code
  2. Complete application - Fully functional web app
  3. Scientific report (PDF) - Document methodology, improvements, results
  4. GitHub repository - Clean, documented code repository
  5. Oral presentation - Prepare to present your work

  Suggested Development Order:

  1. First improve the core algorithm (accuracy, robustness)
  2. Set up basic web application framework
  3. Integrate star catalog data
  4. Build UI components (upload, display, results)
  5. Test with the 12 test star fields mentioned
  6. Document everything for the report
  7. Prepare presentation materials

  The project essentially transforms your current star matching algorithm into a practical application that can identify real stars from user-uploaded images by matching them against astronomical catalogs.

● Here are the detailed steps to complete your star identification project:

  Phase 1: Algorithm Enhancement

  1. Algorithm Optimization (Week 1-2)

  - Accuracy improvements:
    - Fine-tune matching thresholds (currently 0.03 for triangles, 0.02 for quads)
    - Implement weighted voting based on match quality scores
    - Add multiple shape sizes (not just k=4 neighbors, try k=3,5,6)
    - Use both triangles AND quadrilaterals for better redundancy
    - Implement RANSAC or similar outlier rejection
  - Efficiency improvements:
    - Add KD-tree or Ball-tree for faster nearest neighbor searches
    - Implement early termination in matching when confidence is high
    - Cache computed features to avoid recalculation
    - Parallelize feature matching using multiprocessing

  2. Algorithm Robustness (Week 2-3)

  - Noise handling:
    - Implement adaptive thresholding based on image statistics
    - Add morphological operations (opening/closing) for cleaner star detection
    - Use median filtering for salt-and-pepper noise
    - Implement sub-pixel accuracy for star centroids
  - Transformation invariance:
    - Add rotation invariant features (angle histograms)
    - Implement scale estimation between images
    - Handle partial field matching (when only subset of stars visible)
    - Add brightness normalization for varied exposure conditions

  Phase 2: Star Catalog Integration

  3. Star Catalog Setup (Week 3-4)

  - Download catalogs:
    - Hipparcos catalog (118,218 stars, good for bright stars)
    - Tycho-2 catalog (2.5 million stars)
    - Or use simplified Yale Bright Star Catalog (9,110 stars)
  - Database creation:
    - Convert catalog to SQLite database for fast queries
    - Index by position (RA/Dec) and magnitude
    - Store star names, constellations, spectral types
    - Create spatial index for region queries
  - Coordinate transformation:
    - Implement image plate solving (pixel to RA/Dec conversion)
    - Add World Coordinate System (WCS) support
    - Handle different image projections

  Phase 3: Application Development
